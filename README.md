# matlab-polygon-clipper
An unofficial fork of Erik Johnson's MEX interface to Angus Johnsons's polygon clipper.

BRANCHES:
   main -- contains Erik Johnson's code with minor fixes
   polygon -- adapted to work with the polygon class in https://github.com/martinherrerias/matlab-utils

FUNCTIONS:
   polyclip -- find the difference, intersection, xor or union of two polygons
   polyout  -- outset (or inset) a polygon's vertices

The work is done by the MEX file matlab/clipper (which must be compiled).

INSTALLATION

   Clone repo (make sure you are on the 'polygon' branch):
   
      git clone --branch polygon https://github.com/martinherrerias/matlab-polygon-clipper.git

   Make '.../clipper/matlab' the working directory, and compile for your platform:

      mex '-D__int64=__int64_t' '-I../cpp' '../cpp/clipper.cpp' 'mexclipper.cpp'

   Run polyclip_test and polyout_test to check that everything works allright.
